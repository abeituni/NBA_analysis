# **NBA Analysis - Segment 1**
A shared repository for the final project.

## Presentation 
##### *Topic*
A combination of NBA season averages and advanced stats from 5 seasons were clustered using unsupervised machine learning. We want to visualize how NBA players can be grouped according to their stats and performance.

##### *Reason for selecting topic*
With the high interest we have in basketball and all the available data we have for this industry, we want to use our data analytic skills to dig deep into analyzing NBA players.

##### *Description of source of data*
- The data is gathered from [Basketball Reference](http://basketball-reference.com/)
- We used the NBA player stats and advanced stats specifically pergame. 


##### *Question that we hope to answer*
We hope to find out which NBA players have the most similar stats spanning across seasons from 2016 through 2021.
