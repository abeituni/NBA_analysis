## Tools
* We will use an Unsupervised Machine learning to cluster players based off of its judgements on the statistics presented to them. 
* Our elbow curve indicated that would be used to 2, however we are experimenting with other numbers as well.

A shared repository for the final project.

## Update

* Our first ML model took in all of our statistical stats into the machine. The elbow curve indicated we should use 2 clusters. 
* We decided to ignore the elbow curve for the model and use 5 clusters instead. Our idea behind this was we wanted our first model to group the players by 5
