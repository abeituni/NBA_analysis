# NBA_analysis
The technologies & programs we will be implementing for our project are listed below.

#### Data Source: 
We utilized NBA player statistics from basketball-reference.com. The website allowed us to download the data into CSV files. We downloaded ten CSV files, one for each season with the individual player statistic and one with advanced statistics for each season. We collected fives season from 2016 to 2021.

#### Cleaning/Formatting Data:
We created a jupyter notebook file, "CleaningData," to read into CSVs files and re-format columns using Python. We used Pandas to create DataFrames from the CSVs and merge them into one DataFrame per season. We then exported new cleaned CSV files.

#### Database Storage: 
* Python to PostgreSQL/pgAdmin
#### Machine Learning: 
* Python
##### Visualization Software: 
* Tableau
